# What is Objective-C?
Objective-C, a computer programming language, was created by Tom Love and Brad Cox in 1980. They got the idea from two other programming languages called C and Smalltalk. In the 1980s and 1990s, NeXT used Objective-C in their computer operating systems. In 1997, Apple bought another company called NeXT. After that, most of the things Apple made were developed using Objective-C. You can find Objective-C in many Apple products like iOS, MacOS, and other Apple products. Basically, it's an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language.
