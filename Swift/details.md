# What is Swift?
Swift is an programming language that was developed in 2010 by Chris Lattner and several colleagues at Apple. And then release in 2014. A year later, Swift becomes open-source.

This programming language is an alternative to build software in Apple devices. Previously, the developers use Objective-C to build software in Apple devices. Swift took language ideas from Objective-C, Python, Rust, Haskell, Ruby, C#, CLU, and many more. Therefore, the Swift syntax is similar with those languages.

## Language Characteristic
- General purpose
- Compiled programming
- Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP)
- Functional programming
- Generic programming

## How to write code in Swift?
You can choose Xcode as an IDE to making programs in Swift. This is how to print "Hello World!" in Swift:

```swift
print("Hello World!")
```

You don't need to add semicolon at the end of the line (Similar like Python).
