JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995. If you don't know him, he is co-founder of Mozilla company and he also a founder of Brave Software (a web browser company). The naming of this language is similar to another programming language. It is  Java. Despite their similar names, Java and JavaScript are not the same. They have very different syntax, semantics, and use. The amazing thing about this language is Brendan Eich developed JavaScript in only 10 days.

JavaScript is very common in web development, both client-side and server-side. JavaScript can make your website more interactive. Very different from just HTML and CSS.

## Language Characteristic
- Interpreted language
- Scripting language
- Dynamic typing
- Prototype-based language
- Single threaded
- Functional programming
- Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP)

## How to write code in JavaScript?
You don't need to install anything to write a simple JavaScript program. You can use notepad if you feel comfortable. But, if you want coding more easily, then you can install an IDE, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

Here is a simple code to print "Hello World!":

```js
console.log("Hello World!");
```

You can add that code to HTML file, like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body> 

    <script>
        // JavaScript code to print 'Hello World!' to the console
        console.log("Hello World!");
    </script>

</body>
</html>

```
